        {
            "question": "What is angular acceleration?",
            "answer": "The rate at which the angular velocity of an item changes is known as its angular acceleration. It is expressed in squared radians per second. Various causes, such as a change in the object's moment of inertia, a change in the net torque exerted on the item, or a combination of both, can result in angular acceleration."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are the units of angular acceleration?",
            "answer": "The rate at which the angular velocity of an item changes over time is determined by its angular acceleration. Radians per second squared (rad/s2) is the most popular unit for rotational acceleration. Other units, such as degrees per second squared (°/s2) and revolutions per second squared (rev/s2), can be used to calculate angular acceleration. "
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the difference between angular acceleration and linear acceleration?",
            "answer": "The rate of change of angular velocity in rotational motion is measured by angular acceleration, which is commonly given in radians per second squared (rad/s2). The rate of change of linear velocity in a straight line is measured by linear acceleration, which is often expressed in meters per second squared (m/s2). The important distinction is between rotating motion, which is used to describe angular acceleration, and straight-line motion, which is used to describe linear acceleration."
        },
        {
            "question": "How can I calculate angular acceleration?            ",
            "answer": "By dividing the change in angular velocity by the change in time, one may get the angle of acceleration. The angular acceleration equation is:Angular acceleration () is equal to the product of the angular velocity () and the time (t) changes."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are some examples of angular acceleration?",
            "answer": "In real life, angular acceleration can be seen in the following exampl A spinning top suffers angular acceleration as its rotational speed changes as a result of outside forces or friction when it is set in motion. Turning a car: A turning car experiences angular acceleration when its wheels change direction, which alters its rotational motion. Gymnastics or diving: As athletes shift their body positions and spin or twist through the air during aerial maneuvers or rotations, they experience angular acceleration."
